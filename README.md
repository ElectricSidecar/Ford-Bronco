## Generations

- **First Generation (1966-1977)**: The original Bronco was introduced as a compact off-road vehicle to compete with the Jeep CJ-5. It featured a short wheelbase, simple design, and was available in wagon, pickup, and roadster configurations. Engine options included straight-six and V8 powerplants, with standard four-wheel drive.

- **Second Generation (1978-1979)**: Based on the F-100 platform, this generation marked a significant shift to a larger size. It was only available in a three-door wagon body style and came standard with the 351M/400M V8 engines and part-time four-wheel drive.

- **Third Generation (1980-1986)**: Redesigned to be more fuel-efficient during the energy crisis, this generation was based on the Ford F-Series platform. It featured improved aerodynamics, new front suspension design, and various powertrain options including the 300 I6, 302 V8, and 351 V8.

- **Fourth Generation (1987-1991)**: This generation received aerodynamic styling updates while maintaining its body-on-frame construction. Notable improvements included fuel injection, rear anti-lock brakes, and modern safety features. It continued to share many components with the F-150.

- **Fifth Generation (1992-1996)**: The final generation of the classic Bronco featured updated styling, improved safety features, and modernized interior amenities. It was available with either the 302 V8 or 351 V8 engine and maintained its removable hardtop design.

- **Sixth Generation (2021-present)**: After a 25-year hiatus, Ford revived the Bronco as a dedicated off-road SUV. Available in both two-door and four-door configurations, it features retro-inspired styling with modern technology. Powertrain options include a 2.3L EcoBoost four-cylinder and a 2.7L EcoBoost V6, paired with either a seven-speed manual or 10-speed automatic transmission.
